        <h3 id="explanationoftheuserinterface">Explanation of the user interface</h3>

        <p>At the top of the interface you can see a status message telling you which player's turn it is and what has been rolled.<br/>
            The following buttons are available:
    <ul>
        <li>New Game:   Start a new Game.</li>
        <li>Undo(u):    Revert the last move.</li>
        <li>Redo(r):    Remake the reverted move.</li>
        <li>Next(n):    End your turn.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 id="gameinstructions">Game Instructions</h3>

        <h4 id="goalofthegame">Goal of the game</h4>

        <p>The first player who moves one of his pieces with an exact roll onto the top most field wins!</p>

        <h4 id="courseofthegame">Course of the game</h4>

        <p>The first Player starts. Whose turn it is, dices and draws accordingly with one of his piece. The number rolled must always be drawn completely. You can't draw into one's base. It is sometimes not possible to draw with a piece.  In this case, the player will skip one round. The player on the turn decides which piece to draw with.</p>

        <h4 id="theblockingstones">The blocking stones</h4>

        <p>Blocking stones are obstacles that cannot be jumped over. In order to clear them out of the way, a figure with an exact roll must land on a field occupied by a boulder. The player at the turn takes the boulder and places it, with the exception of the lowest row, on any square of the board. </p>

        <h4 id="hittinganotherplayerspieces">Hitting another player's pieces</h4>

        <p>Only one piece may be placed on each square. If a figure with an exact throw hits a field that is already occupied by another figure, it is hit and reset to one of the starting fields of its color. From here it can be brought back into play.</p>

        <p>This implementation comes along with a <em>TUI</em> (textual user interface) and <em>GUI</em>
            (graphical user interface).</p>
